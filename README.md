What is Network Intrusion? Definition?

Answer- A network intrusion is any illegal activity carried out on a digital network. Network incursions frequently entail the theft
        of valuable network resources and virtually always compromise a network security and/or data security. 

        A network is often compromised for one of the following three reasons:

        **Hacktivism**: Hacktivism is the combination of hacking with activism. Intruders that wish to hack to prove a political agenda or social cause are responsible.

       ** Steal Money**: This infiltration aims to steal money or data from the victim. Typically, the intent is to abuse the other person for monetary advantage.

        **Spying**: Spying is the entrance of a state-sponsored network in order to spy on an adversary or occasionally an ally.

        **How to Detect Network Intrusion?**
        
        IDS (Intrusion Detection System) monitors networks for suspicious and malicious activities, as well as false alarms. It implies that enterprises must have intrusion detection systems to distinguish between normal network traffic and                 malicious activities. There are two distinct types of intrusion detection systems:
        
        Host Intrusion Detection System: This system operates on network hosts or standalone devices. It takes a snapshot of the current system files and compares it to prior snapshots. Similarly, if the analytical system files are modified or             destroyed, an alert is sent to the administrator for further inquiry.
        
        Network Intrusion Detection System: They are strategically located across the network to monitor traffic from all devices connected to the Internet. Primarily, it performs an analysis of passing traffic on the whole subnet and compares             that information to a database of known threats. When it detects an assault or detects strange activity, it alerts the administrator. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a hardware device or software program that employs established             intrusion signatures to recognize and analyze both incoming and outgoing network data for specific abnormal actions. It is accomplished largely through the following methods:
        
        Monitoring system setups and settings
        Monitoring user behavior in order to identify nefarious intent
        Scanning techniques that discover hazardous pattern indicators
        System file comparisons against malware signatures
        With the identification of a security policy violation, malware, or configuration issue, IDS can remove a malicious user from the network and notify security personnel. Despite these advantages, which include in-depth network traffic               analysis and attack detection, the IDS has intrinsic downsides, such as a lack of flexibility. It employs known intrusion signatures to identify assaults; freshly discovered threats are not identified. Additionally, an IDS may identify             ongoing attacks, not just incoming ones. To avoid all of these threats, intrusion prevention solutions are essential.
        
        Protocol-based Intrusion Detection System (PIDS): It attempts to protect the web server by continuously checking the HTTPS protocol stream and allowing the associated HTTP protocol. As HTTPS is not secured, this system would need to live           in this interface prior to accessing its web presentation layer in order to use HTTPS.
        
        Application Protocol-based Intrusion Detection System (APIDS): APIDS is a system or agent that often lives within a cluster of computers. It discovers intrusions by monitoring and analyzing application-specific protocol traffic. This would         monitor, for instance, the SQL protocol specific to the middleware as it interacts with the database on the web server.
        
        Hybrid Intrusion Detection System: A hybrid intrusion detection system is comprised of two or more intrusion detection system techniques. In the hybrid intrusion detection system, host agent or system data is coupled with network data to           get a comprehensive view of the network system. The effectiveness of the hybrid intrusion detection system surpasses that of the other intrusion detection.




         **Prevention**

         Typically, intrusion prevention systems are placed behind a firewall to serve as an additional filter against malicious activities. As a result of their in-line placement, intrusion prevention systems are able to analyze and automatically          respond to all network traffic flows. These steps may include informing administrators, discarding harmful packets, suspending traffic from the malicious activity's originating address(es), and resuming connections. Importantly, a good             intrusion prevention system must be efficient so as not to degrade network performance. In order to detect harmful activity in real-time and minimize false positives, intrusion prevention systems must also function swiftly and correctly.
